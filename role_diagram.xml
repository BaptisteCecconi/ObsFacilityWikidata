Document authors (ivoatex maintainers have different rules):

* svn cp this file to role_diagram.xml, and then:

* Remove all <rec> elements in there referring to standards not related
  to the current one,

* change the tag name for the current one from rec to thisrec

* make role_diagram.pdf

For the time being, keep both role_diagram.pdf and role_diagram.svg as
created by this in the VCS.  This helps document builds on machines
with missing dependencies.


Archdiag maintainers: When adding boxes here, first look for a good place,
preferably in one of the grid positions given in the comments for the
WGs (e.g., 55 for Registry).  Good y positions are ones that already
exist.  Leave out the w at first.

Then, run

make archdiag-debug.svg

and open archdiag-debug.svg in a javascript-enabled browser.  In that 
browser's javascript console you will see lines like:

SpectralDM: 67; 11.5

The first number is the box's natural width, which you should use in the w
attribute of the rec/prerec.  The second is the offset to x you'd need to
add to one of the x grid lines (the x=something in the opening comments
of the various sections) to have the box centered.
